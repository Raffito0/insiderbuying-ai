# Section 10: Cross-Chain Integration Tests

## Overview

This is the final section of the e2e suite. It creates `tests/insiderbuying/e2e/08-cross-chain.test.js` — 5 tests that verify the wire-format contract between chains. Where the per-chain files (sections 03–09) prove each chain works in isolation, this file proves that what Chain A writes is actually readable by Chain B.

**Dependency**: All 7 chain test files (sections 03–09) must exist and pass before working on this section, because this file imports helpers and mock shapes that those tests establish.

**Key constraint**: This file must run single-threaded (`--runInBand`). The Jest e2e project config already enforces this via `maxWorkers: 1`. Do not add `--runInBand` manually to any run command — the config handles it.

## What "Cross-Chain" Means

Each pipeline chain (alert, article, Reddit, X, report, newsletter, outreach) ends with a persistence write to NocoDB/Supabase and/or an X/newsletter post. The downstream chain reads from the same storage. A field rename in Chain 1's write payload silently breaks Chain 4's read — no existing unit test catches it.

Cross-chain tests catch this using the **capture-and-replay** pattern:

1. Call Chain A's write function with a spy `fetchFn`.
2. Capture the POST/PATCH body from `spyFn.mock.calls[N][1].body` (the second argument of the fetch call, which is the request options object).
3. Parse the captured body (it is JSON-encoded).
4. Verify it has the exact field names Chain B's read function expects.
5. Configure Chain B's read `fetchFn` to return that exact captured object.
6. Call Chain B's read/process function and assert it handles the data correctly.

This pattern avoids building a fake stateful database and tests the actual serialized wire format.

## Tests

### Test 8.1 — Alert (Chain 1) write payload is compatible with X auto-post (Chain 4) read

**What it proves**: `generateAlertTweet` in Chain 4 receives the fields it expects when Chain 1's persistence write is replayed as Chain 4's alert query response.

**Pattern**:
1. Construct a scored alert object with `significance_score: 9` and a known ticker (e.g., `'NVDA'`).
2. Call Chain 1's NocoDB write function (the function that persists the scored alert record) with a spy `fetchFn`.
3. Capture the body: `JSON.parse(spyFn.mock.calls[0][1].body)`.
4. Assert the captured object contains `ticker` and `significance_score`.
5. Configure a new `fetchFn` via `makeFetch(capturedPayload)` to return that object as Chain 4's alert query response.
6. Call `generateAlertTweet` with the data Chain 4 would extract from that query response.
7. Assert the returned tweet string contains `$NVDA` (or the captured ticker formatted as a cashtag) and `significance_score` from the captured payload.

**Stub**:
```javascript
it('Alert write payload is compatible with Chain 4 x-auto-post read', async () => {
  // Step 1: build scored alert
  // Step 2-3: spy on write, capture body
  // Step 4: assert shape
  // Step 5-6: replay into generateAlertTweet
  // Step 7: assert cashtag + score in tweet
});
```

### Test 8.2 — Article (Chain 2) write payload is compatible with X auto-post (Chain 4) read

**What it proves**: `generateArticleTweet` in Chain 4 receives the `headline` and `url` it needs when Chain 2's article write payload is replayed.

**Pattern**:
1. Construct a published article object with known `headline` and `url`.
2. Call Chain 2's NocoDB write function (`writeArticle`) with a spy `fetchFn`.
3. Capture the POST body.
4. Assert the captured object contains `headline` and `url`.
5. Feed as Chain 4's article query response via `makeFetch(capturedPayload)`.
6. Call `generateArticleTweet` with the data Chain 4 extracts.
7. Assert the returned string contains the captured `headline` and `url`.

**Stub**:
```javascript
it('Article write payload is compatible with Chain 4 x-auto-post read', async () => {
  // Step 1: build published article
  // Step 2-3: spy on writeArticle, capture body
  // Step 4: assert headline + url present
  // Step 5-6: replay into generateArticleTweet
  // Step 7: assert headline and url in tweet string
});
```

### Test 8.3 — Alert (Chain 1) write payload is compatible with Newsletter (Chain 6) aggregation

**What it proves**: The newsletter aggregator in Chain 6 can consume what Chain 1 writes — specifically that `ticker`, `significance_score`, and `analysis_summary` are present with those exact field names.

**Pattern**:
1. Construct an analyzed alert with `ticker`, `significance_score`, and `analysis_summary`.
2. Call Chain 1's persistence write with a spy `fetchFn`. Capture the body.
3. Assert the captured object contains all three fields.
4. Configure Chain 6's alert data fetch to return an array containing the captured payload.
5. Call the newsletter data aggregation function.
6. Assert the aggregated newsletter data (the return value or an intermediate structure) contains `ticker`, `significance_score`, and `analysis_summary` from the captured alert.

**Stub**:
```javascript
it('Alert write payload fields appear in newsletter aggregation', async () => {
  // Step 1: scored + analyzed alert
  // Step 2-3: capture write body
  // Step 4: assert ticker, significance_score, analysis_summary
  // Step 5: feed into Chain 6 aggregator
  // Step 6: assert fields present in aggregated data
});
```

### Test 8.4 — Article (Chain 2) write payload is compatible with Newsletter (Chain 6) aggregation

**What it proves**: The newsletter summary section receives `headline` and `url` from the article write payload, not undefined.

**Pattern**:
1. Construct a published article with `headline` and `url`.
2. Call `writeArticle` with a spy. Capture the body.
3. Assert `headline` and `url` are present.
4. Feed as Chain 6's article query response.
5. Call the newsletter orchestrator.
6. Assert the newsletter summary section content contains the captured `headline` and `url`.

**Stub**:
```javascript
it('Article write payload headline and url appear in newsletter summary', async () => {
  // Step 1: published article
  // Step 2-3: spy on writeArticle, capture body
  // Step 4: assert headline + url
  // Step 5: feed into Chain 6 orchestrator
  // Step 6: assert headline and url in summary section
});
```

---

### Test 8.5 — Report (Chain 5) assembly writes `status: 'published'` to NocoDB

**What it proves**: After Chain 5 assembles the full report, its persistence PATCH to NocoDB contains `status: 'published'` and the correct report ID. This verifies the write contract that any downstream consumer (including Chain 6 if it surfaces reports) depends on.

**Pattern**:
1. Construct a complete mock report data object with a known report ID.
2. Call the report assembly function and its persistence call with a spy `fetchFn`.
3. Capture the PATCH body from `spyFn.mock.calls[0][1].body`.
4. Assert the captured body contains `status: 'published'`.
5. Assert the captured body contains the correct report ID.

**Stub**:
```javascript
it('Report assembly PATCH body contains status: published and report ID', async () => {
  // Step 1: mock report data with known ID
  // Step 2-3: spy on persistence call, capture PATCH body
  // Step 4: assert status === 'published'
  // Step 5: assert report ID present
});
```

## How to Capture Fetch Call Bodies

When a module calls `fetchFn(url, { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) })`, the spy captures:
- `spyFn.mock.calls[0][0]` — the URL string
- `spyFn.mock.calls[0][1]` — the options object (method, headers, body)
- `spyFn.mock.calls[0][1].body` — the JSON string of the payload

To get the parsed object:
```javascript
const capturedBody = JSON.parse(spyFn.mock.calls[0][1].body);
```

If the module makes multiple fetch calls (e.g., one for Supabase, one for NocoDB), use `makeRouter` for the spy so calls route correctly, and inspect the specific call index that corresponds to the persistence write. Identify the correct call index by filtering on URL substring:

```javascript
const persistenceCall = spyFn.mock.calls.find(([url]) => url.includes('nocodb'));
const capturedBody = JSON.parse(persistenceCall[1].body);
```

---

## Imports Pattern

```javascript
const { makeFetch, makeRouter, makeFetchSeq, BASE_ENV, noSleep } = require('./helpers');
// Import Chain 1 write function
const { writeAlertRecord } = require('../../../src/pipelines/alert/write-persistence');
// Import Chain 4 tweet generator
const { generateAlertTweet, generateArticleTweet } = require('../../../src/pipelines/x/x-auto-post');
// Import Chain 2 write function
const { writeArticle } = require('../../../src/pipelines/article/write-article');
// Import Chain 6 aggregator
const { aggregateNewsletterData } = require('../../../src/pipelines/newsletter/aggregate');
// Import Chain 5 report builder
const { buildReportRecord } = require('../../../src/pipelines/report/build-report-record');
```

Adjust import paths to match the actual module locations in `ryan_cole/insiderbuying-site/src/`. Verify each path resolves before running the test — a bad import path causes all 5 tests to fail with a module-not-found error.

---

## Common Failure Modes

**"Cannot read property 'ticker' of undefined"**: The captured payload shape does not match what the downstream function expects. Print `capturedBody` in the test to debug. The field is either renamed or nested differently than expected.

**"fetchFn called 0 times"**: The write function was never reached because an upstream step failed silently. Add `console.log` in `beforeEach` after each chain step to find which step produced `null` or `undefined`.

**"Unexpected extra fetch call"**: The module makes more HTTP calls than the spy is set up for. Use `makeRouter` instead of `makeFetchSeq` for the write spy so all calls are handled without throwing.

**All 5 tests fail simultaneously**: Usually a bad import path at the top of the file. Check that the path to each production module is correct and run `node -e "require('./path/to/module')"` to verify.
