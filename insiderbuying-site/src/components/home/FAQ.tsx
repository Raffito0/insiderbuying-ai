    q: "Is tracking insider buying legal?",
    a: "Yes. All data comes from SEC Form 4 filings, which are public records. Company insiders are legally required to report their trades within 2 business days.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast are the alerts?",
    a: "Pro members receive alerts within 60 seconds of the SEC filing. Free members see the same data delayed by 15 minutes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this financial advice?",
    a: "No. EarlyInsider provides data and AI-powered analysis of publicly available SEC filings. All investment decisions are yours. We are not registered investment advisors.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I create a custom watchlist?",
    a: "Yes, Pro members can create unlimited watchlists and receive alerts only for the stocks they track.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from OpenInsider?",
    a: "OpenInsider shows raw data with a delay. We provide real-time alerts within 60 seconds, AI analysis on every trade, conviction scoring, historical pattern matching, and a clean interface designed for action.",

  {
    q: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    a: "Yes. Cancel your Pro subscription at any time with one click. No contracts, no cancellation fees.",
